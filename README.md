## Project Overview

This project proposes the creation of a Generative AI and RAG-powered chatbot meant specifically to answer questions and provide tutorials for solving bioinformatics problems based on numerous pre-provided methods.

## Project Abstract

This document proposes a novel application of a text message (SMS or Email) read-out and hands-free call interacted between an Android Smartphone and an infotainment platform (headunit) in a car environment. When a phone receives an SMS or Email, the text message is transferred from the phone to the headunit through a Bluetooth connection. On the headunit, user can control which and when the received SMS or E-mail to be read out through the in-vehicle audio system. The user may press one button on the headunit to activate the hands-free feature to call back the SMS sender.

## High Level Requirement

Describe the requirements – i.e., what the product does and how it does it from a user point of view – at a high level.

## Conceptual Design

The frontend user interface of this app will be built using **React.js, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**. This will allow for the creation of a clean and lightweight application for UI components, a satisfying user interface, and one that can handle user interactions well. It will also be responsible for sending user queries to the AI system, holding the chat history for context, and allowing users to download their conversation so that the method tutorial can be saved. The backend will be built using **Python** and **Flask**. The chatbot will be powered by **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to retrieve the correct method for the problem given by the user, and an **LLM** to use the provided method from the RAG to create a tutorial for the user.

## Background

Bioinformatics is a rapidly growing field that is using breakthroughs in Computer Science and Machine Learning to study and solve biological problems. Multiple Nobel Prizes in the past few years have been won in the fields of Biology and Chemistry by computer scientists. However, given the differences between both the content and the people in the respective fields, clear and effective communication can be a challenge. With the breakthroughs in the AI field and the rise of Large Language Models, the ability to bridge this gap has never been easier, allowing researchers on both sides of the academic 'fence' to easily learn about and work in the field of Bioinformatics. With that in mind, this Chatbot is meant to help bridge that communication gap, with the ability to customize answers and answer specific questions surrounding bioinformatics.
