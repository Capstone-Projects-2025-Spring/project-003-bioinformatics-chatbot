The cell cycle is a crucial process in all living cells, allowing them to grow, replicate, and divide. It ensures that genetic material is accurately copied and distributed to daughter cells, preserving the function and integrity of organisms. The cycle consists of two main phases: interphase and the mitotic phase. Interphase is the longest part of the cycle and is divided into three stages: G1, S, and G2. 
During G1, the cell grows, synthesizes proteins, and prepares for DNA replication, while also checking that conditions are favorable for division. If conditions are right, the cell moves into the S phase, where DNA replication occurs. Each chromosome is copied, resulting in two sister chromatids per chromosome. 
After the DNA is replicated, the cell enters G2, where it continues to grow, synthesizes additional proteins, and checks that DNA replication was accurate. If errors are detected, the cell may repair them or undergo apoptosis, a programmed cell death.

Once interphase is complete, the cell enters the mitotic phase, where the process of cell division takes place. 
Mitosis, the first part of the mitotic phase, involves the division of the nucleus. It is broken down into five stages: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase, and cytokinesis. In prophase, the chromosomes condense and become visible, and the nuclear membrane begins to break down. The mitotic spindle forms, and spindle fibers attach to the chromosomes. In metaphase, the chromosomes align at the cell’s center along the metaphase plate. During anaphase, the sister chromatids are pulled apart toward opposite poles of the cell. In telophase, new nuclear membranes form around the two sets of chromosomes, and they begin to de-condense. Cytokinesis, the final step, is the division of the cytoplasm, resulting in two distinct daughter cells. 
In animal cells, this is achieved by the formation of a cleavage furrow, while in plant cells, a cell plate forms.

The cell cycle is tightly regulated by proteins like cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), which control the progression of the cell through the cycle’s phases. Checkpoints in G1, G2, and M phases monitor DNA integrity and cell conditions, ensuring that the cell only proceeds when everything is in order. 
If something goes wrong, such as DNA damage or unregulated growth, the cell may pause division, repair itself, or, in extreme cases, undergo programmed cell death. When the regulation of the cell cycle fails, it can result in uncontrolled cell division, a characteristic of cancer. Understanding the cell cycle is essential for fields like genetics, medicine, and cellular biology, as it plays a fundamental role in growth, tissue repair, and reproduction.
