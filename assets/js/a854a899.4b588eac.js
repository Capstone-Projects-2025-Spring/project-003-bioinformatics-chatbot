With the breakthroughs in the AI field and the rise of Large Language Models, the ability to bridge this gap has never been easier, allowing researchers on both sides of the academic 'fence' to easily learn about and work in the field of Bioinformatics. With that in mind, this Chatbot is meant to help bridge that communication gap, with the ability to customize answers and answer specific questions surrounding bioinformatics."})]})}function d(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,n.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,o.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,o.jsx)(h,{...e})}):h(e)}},28453:(e,t,i)=>{i.d(t,{R:()=>s,x:()=>a});var o=i(96540);const n={},r=o.createContext(n);function s(e){const t=o.useContext(r);return o.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function a(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(n):e.components||n:s(e.components),o.createElement(r.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
