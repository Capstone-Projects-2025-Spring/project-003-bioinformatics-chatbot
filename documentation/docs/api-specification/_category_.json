The frontend-API specifies the React components responsible for rendering the user interface, accepting user input,  displaying chatbot responses, and maintaining application features. The backend-API specifies the Flask server's endpoint that supports the uploading of PDF files, interaction with the database, communication with the LLM, and retrieval of relevant data. Both documents together detail a complete overview of the software implementation."
