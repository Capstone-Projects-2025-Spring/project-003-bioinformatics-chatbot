It includes diagrams such as class, sequence, and entity-relationship diagrams to visualize the structure and data flow. Additionally, it describes key algorithms, database design, development environment, and version control procedures. This serves as a blueprint for developers, project managers, and stakeholders to ensure a clear understanding of the systemâ€™s architecture and implementation plan."
