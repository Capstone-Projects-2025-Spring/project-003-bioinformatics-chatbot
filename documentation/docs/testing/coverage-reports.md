# Coverage Reports

### Instructions
Once you click on either of the coverage report links, Docusaurus may initially show a "Page Not Found" error. To view the coverage reports, **please reload the page**. These reports are dynamically rendered HTML files, which do not fit within Docusaurusâ€™s usual rendering patterns.

To return to the main pages, you can either:

- Open a new instance of the documentation.

- Or, after clicking "back," reload the page again.
