# Acceptance test

With Vitest and pytest we can simulate complete interactions that represent
complete requirements for the project. Vitest allows for full front end navigation
testing and component testing, thereby allowing for both functional and non-functional requirements
to be tested. On the backend, pytest provides the tools needed for us to test API endpoints and
databse interactions, thereby ensuring data integrity and expected behavior. Through the use of 
pytest's mocking capabilities, we can simulate important scenarios like user authentication, 
request handling, and error responses. Together, Vitest and pytest allow us to 
perform comprehensive end-to-end testing, therefore ensuring that our frontend and backend work
seamlessly while maintaining reliability and performance.
