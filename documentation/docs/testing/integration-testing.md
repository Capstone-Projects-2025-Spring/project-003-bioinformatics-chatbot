# Integration tests

## Backend 
Pytest and Flask provide easy integration testing py providing test clients to
make calls on a built application. Python makes it easy to mock any data we
might need to test via the unittest module.

## Frontend
Viteest allows us to test components in a way that tests their functionality with
the backend. With axios we can make real requests to the backend using front
end components and validate the data returned.
