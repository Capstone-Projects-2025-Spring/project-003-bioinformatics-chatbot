# Integration tests

## Backend 
Pytest and Flask provide easy integration testing by providing test clients to
make API calls on a built application. Python makes it easy to mock any data we
might need to test via the unittest module.

## Frontend
Vitest allows us to test components in a way that ensures their functionality when
interacting with the backend. With Axios we can make real API requests to the backend using front
end components and validate that the frontend correctly processes and displays the received data.
